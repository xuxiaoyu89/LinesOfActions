# LinesOfActions
my Social Multiplayer Game 

The rules are quite simple:
1. there are 12 checkers in each color, red and white;
2. the goal is to connect all the checkers in the same color;
3. a player can move the checkers in 8 directions: vertically, horizentally, and diagnally.
4. the number of steps of a move must be the same with the number of checkers in that line.
5. a checker cannot pass an enemy checker. For example, a red checker cannot move if there is a white checker in its way.
